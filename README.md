# Econometrics 1

This class is designed as a first-year econometrics course at the graduate level. The course focuses on the basic econometric theory with computer applications. We will cover all of the traditional econometrics technique starting from the simple and the multiple regression models to the simultaneous equation system estimation. In addition, we will introduce more advanced models which utilize longitudinal samples. In all these models, the emphasis will be on statistical inference and we will also pay attention to the application of the models in industrial organization, labor, health, and elsewhere in economics and social sciences. It is hoped that throughout the course, students will gain a thorough knowledge and understanding of econometrics theory and also develop useful skills in applying the methods to the empirical work. The focus will be on empirical work rather than on theoretical topics.

Along the way we will learn how to program in the R statistical programming language.  All of the files are generated in R-markdown files to allow you to see all of the code and lectures in one place.
